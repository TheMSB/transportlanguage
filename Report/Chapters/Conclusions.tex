\chapter{Conclusions}

We found the project a lot of fun to do.
This started with inventing our own language.
After having the idea to make a language inspired by Transport Tycoon Deluxe, coming up with a syntax required a lot of ingenuity since it was hard to come up with good analogies.
We also tried to make the language not too easy to use, since that would ruin part of the fun.
However, OTLD proved to be more usable than anticipated.

Writing an Antlr grammar and visitor was not too difficult for us after following the Vertalerbouw course.
However, the Java bytecode proved to be a good challenge.
Luckily, the Java VM is very well documented.
Also, the ASM library takes a lot of the difficult work out of our hands, like calculating frames, maximum stack and local variable sizes, besides just providing a good interface for writing Java class files.

We would have liked to put more time and effort into the project to improve our language, documentation and implementation.
However, other courses at the UT also required a lot of our time.
Therefore almost all of the work had to be done after July 6th, which put a bit of stress on our work.

In conclusion, we learned from working on this project, besides from it only being fun.
Although we would have liked to add more features, we are happy with the result.
