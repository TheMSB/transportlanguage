\chapter{Introduction}

Open Transport Language Deluxe (OTLD) is a programming language designed for the Compiler Construction course at the University of Twente.

\section{The language}

The language resembles Pascal, but the terminology is based on the ideas of the game `Open Transport Tycoon Deluxe'.
An OTLD program, a \emph{city}, defines all game elements first. The executable code of a program reads like delivery note.

The resemblance of the language with the OpenTTD game allows us to show the meaning of statements with examples from the game. Eventually, we think it would be nice if an OTLD program could be compiled to an OpenTTD save file, but that is out of the scope of the project for now.

\section{This report}

This report describes the OTLD language, including some design considerations and implementation details. The described implementation details include the implementation of the front end compiler, intermediate language and Java bytecode back end compiler.
